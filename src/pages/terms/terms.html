        </p>
        <h4>PAYMENT AND WITHDRAWAL OF PRIZES</h4>
        <p>
        Winners are posted on the Mobile Application.
        Before making any payment, SPORTHITTERS may require that an entrant complete and execute an affidavit of eligibility in which, among other things, the entrant is required to represent and warrant that the entrant is eligible to participate in a Challenge, is otherwise in compliance with this Agreement and, potentially, is required to provide documentation or proof of eligibility and compliance. If SPORTHITTERS requests that an entrant completes and executes such an affidavit and the entrant fails to do so within seven (7) days, or SPORTHITTERS otherwise determines that the entrant does not meet the eligibility requirements or is not in compliance with these Terms, SPORTHITTERS reserves the right to terminate the entrant’s account and withhold or revoke the awarding of any prizes associated with such account. In such a situation, SPORTHITTERS may pay out any withheld or revoked prizes to the other entrants in the relevant Challenge in a manner consistent with the Rules of the Challenge.
        Entrants may withdraw their cash prize awards as well as cash deposits by using the "Withdrawal" option on the Mobile Application. Entrants may be requested to complete an affidavit of eligibility and a liability/publicity release (unless prohibited by law) and/or appropriate tax forms and forms of identification including but not limited to a Driver's License, Proof of Residence, and/or any information relating to payment/deposit accounts as reasonably requested by SPORTHITTERS in order to complete the withdrawal of prizes. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in disqualification and forfeiture of any prizes. Disqualification or forfeiture of any prizes may also occur if it is determined any such entrant did not comply with these Terms of Use in any manner.
        Checks for withdrawal requests are processed within 14 business days, and are sent via U.S. Mail. Promotional deposits, credits, and other bonuses may not be withdrawn from a SPORTHITTERS account unless appropriate terms of the promotion are achieved first by the user.
        All taxes associated with the receipt of any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. In the event that the awarding of any prizes to winners of Challenges is challenged by any legal authority, SPORTHITTERS reserves the right in its sole discretion to determine whether or not to award such prizes.
        No substitution or transfer of prize is permitted, except that SPORTHITTERS reserves the right to substitute a prize of equal value or greater if the advertised prize is unavailable. All prizes are awarded "as is" and without warranty of any kind, express or implied (including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability for a particular purpose).
        Any withdrawal requests, after approved by SPORTHITTERS, will be credited back to the same credit card or method of payment used to deposit funds on the Mobile Application. SPORTHITTERS will only release withdrawals to a different credit card or other payment method other than that which was used to make deposit(s) after the aggregate amount of such deposit(s) has already been released back to the credit card(s) or payment method(s) used for the deposit(s).
        </p>
        <h4>TERMINATION AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION</h4>
        <p>In addition to any other legal or equitable remedy, SPORTHITTERS may, without prior notice, immediately revoke any or all of your rights granted hereunder. In such event, you will immediately cease all access to and use of the SPORTHITTERS Mobile Application. SPORTHITTERS may revoke any password(s) and/or account identification issued to you and deny you access to and use of the Mobile Application.

        Some of the Services may allow you to submit or transmit audio, video, text, or other materials (collectively, "User Submissions") to or through the Services. When you provide User Submissions, you grant to SPORTHITTERS, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and partners a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully sublicenseable license to use, distribute, edit, display, archive, publish, sublicense, perform, reproduce, make available, transmit, broadcast, sell, translate, and create derivative works of those User Submissions, and your name, voice, likeness and other identifying information where part of a User Submission, in any form, media, software, or technology of any kind now known or developed in the future, including, without limitation, for developing, manufacturing, and marketing products.

        ARBITRATION, CONSENT TO JURISDICTION IN NORTH CAROLINA, ATTORNEY’S FEES</h4>
        <p>
        Any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof, or any use of the Mobile Application (including all commercial transactions conducted through the Mobile Application) ("Claims"), except for claims filed in a small claims court that proceed on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, shall be settled by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator appointed by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with its then governing rules and procedures, including the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, where applicable. In agreeing to arbitrate all Claims, you and SPORTHITTERS waive all rights to a trial by jury in any action or proceeding involving any Claim. The arbitration shall be held in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. This arbitration undertaking is made pursuant to and in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement. Subject to the limitations set forth below, the arbitrator shall have authority to award legal and equitable relief available in the courts of the Commonwealth of North Carolina, provided that:
        The arbitrator shall not have authority to award punitive damages; and
        Any and all claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis only, and shall not be consolidated or joined with or in any arbitration or other proceeding involving a Claim of any other party. You and SPORTHITTERS agree that the arbitrator shall have no authority to arbitrate any Claim as a class action or in any other form other than on an individual basis.
        For any Claims that are not subject to arbitration: (a) the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings involving Claims shall be the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting within Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (the "Forum"), and the parties hereby waive any argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the Forum is not appropriate or convenient; (b) you and SPORTHITTERS waive any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any Claims.
        In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any Claim other than an arbitration in accordance with this Section, or initiates a proceeding involving a Claim under this Section other than in the Forum, the other party shall recover all attorneys' fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this Agreement to arbitrate and the Forum to which the parties have herein agreed.
